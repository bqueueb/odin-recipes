    <center><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>World's famous McDonald's french fries !</p>
    </center>

    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lb. Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>cold water</li>
        <li>oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>sea salt (as desired)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a vegetable peeler to first peel all of your potatoes. After that, slice the potatoes into thin fries and give them a thorough water rinse. You can cut your fries anyway you wish; Could try ½ inch thick.</li>
        <li>You are going to make a cold brine now that the potatoes are ready. To do this, thoroughly combine the vinegar, sugar, and cold water in a big bowl. After that, immerse the fries in the brine that has been made, cover the bowl, and chill it for two to four hours.</li>
        <li>You can drain and give the fries a thorough rinse after they have been brined for a few hours. After that, put the fries on some paper towels and pat them dry well.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 inches of oil in a large skillet, sometimes known as a deep fryer, to 300°F (150°C). Next, position a wire rack nearby and arrange paper towels below it. </li>
        <li>You can now add the chopped fries to the heating oil after it has heated up. Simply ensure that they are arranged in a single layer in the skillet and blanch for five minutes. With a slotted spoon, take the fries from the pan to remove any excess oil, and then place them on the wire rack to cool entirely.</li>
        <li>Lastly, just keep doing this until all of the fries have been blanched. Oh, and before you add another batch of fries, you should wait for the oil to reheat for at least ten seconds.</li>
        <li>As a result, after the fries have cooled fully, preheat the same oil to 400°F (200°C). </li>
        <li>The potatoes should then be completely cooled before being carefully re-inserted into the hot oil and fried until golden brown on all sides. Again, as you're doing this, make sure the fries are all in one layer.</li>
        <li>After the fries are cooked through, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a platter lined with paper towels. You may now season your imitation McDonald's fries with as much sea salt as you like once you've fried them all to golden perfection.</li>
    </ol>
