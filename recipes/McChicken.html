    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add three boneless, skinless chicken breasts, one egg, and half a teaspoon of salt to a food processor. Pulse the mixture until it's smooth.</li>
            <li>Place one cup of corn starch in a bowl. Shape the chicken patties with moist palms so that they are slightly thicker than the bun and slightly bigger than it. After coating both sides, put them aside.</li>
            <li>Add the following ingredients to a large mixing bowl: 1 cup water, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup corn starch, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons yellow mustard, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper. Until the batter is smooth, whisk it. </li>
            <li>Apply the batter to the chicken patties. After removing the excess, transfer to a baking tray covered with parchment paper. To harden, place in the freezer for one to two hours. </li>
            <li>To prepare the sauce, combine the mayonnaise (1 cup), salt (1/2 tsp), onion powder (1/2 Tbsp), and dry mustard (1 tsp) in a small mixing dish. Stir thoroughly and reserve. </li>
            <li>When necessary, add canola oil to a deep fryer or large saucepan and heat it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). </li>
            <li>For five minutes, fry the chicken patties. </li>
            <li>Patties should rest for three minutes on a platter covered with paper towels. </li>
            <li>Cook patties for a further five minutes, or until exteriors are golden brown. After draining, use paper towels to pat dry. </li>
            <li>Toast hamburger buns to taste</li>
            <li>Put the chicken patty on the heel bun. Spread the special sauce over the crown and sprinkle the shredded iceberg lettuce on top (to taste). </li>
        </ol>
